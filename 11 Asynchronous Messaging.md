# Asynchronous Eventing in Microservice Architecture Design

Asynchronous eventing plays a crucial role in modern Microservice Architecture, helping to manage long-running transactions and complex workflows that are unsuitable for a single blocking API call. To unravel the intricacies of this model and its utility in distributed systems, we delve into its working, potential use-cases, and benefits.

## Problem Statement <a name="problem-statement"></a>

In a microservices architecture, developers often encounter situations where transactions take considerable time or workflows are too complex to fit within a single, blocking API call. Moreover, certain processes cannot be done in real-time through a blocking call. This is where asynchronous eventing becomes instrumental.

## Understanding Asynchronous Eventing <a name="understanding-asynchronous-eventing"></a>

Asynchronous eventing enables a series of actions to execute in the background, after the client receives an accepted message from the service API. These actions can occur independently of the API, providing flexibility for varying use-cases.

    Participant Client as Client
    Participant API as API
    Participant BackgroundTask as Background Task
    Client->>API: Request
    API-->>Client: Accepted Message
    API->>BackgroundTask: Trigger Event
    BackgroundTask->>API: Completion Message
```

## Role of Service API in Asynchronous Eventing <a name="role-of-service-api-in-asynchronous-eventing"></a>

In asynchronous eventing, a Service API triggers an event, which subsequently cascades asynchronously from the API. Alternatively, a single blocking call can put a message on a messaging system, and once done, the service returns. The processing then continues in an asynchronous fashion behind the scenes.

```mermaid

    Participant API as API
    Participant MessageSystem as Message System
    Client->>API: Blocking Call
    API->>MessageSystem: Put Message
    MessageSystem-->>API: Acknowledge Message
    API-->>Client: Service Returns

```

## Asynchronous Eventing in a Distributed System <a name="asynchronous-eventing-in-a-distributed-system"></a>

Asynchronous eventing proves particularly potent in a distributed system, solving numerous complex issues. Though not a panacea for all software issues, it significantly simplifies tackling complexities in distributed systems.
