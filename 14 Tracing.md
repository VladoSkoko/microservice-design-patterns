# Tracing Patterns in Microservice Architecture Design

Tracing is an essential part of microservices-based systems, assisting in maintaining visibility in complex call stacks that span multiple processes and networks. This guide will dive into the fundamental concepts of tracing patterns in microservice architecture and share the best practices to implement them effectively, using open standards for simplicity and interoperability.

## Tracing in Monolithic vs Microservices Architecture <a name="tracing-in-monolithic-vs-microservices-architecture"></a>

In a monolithic architecture, tracing the execution path from the edge to a database call is relatively straightforward, as all operations occur within a single process.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Monolith
    Client->>Monolith: Request
    Monolith-->>Monolith: Internal processing
    Monolith-->>Client: Response
```

In contrast, microservices architectures involve multiple processes across a network. As such, traditional code tracing methods may not be sufficient to recreate the path of a service call. Tracing techniques in a microservices system inject a trace identifier into every call, which helps recreate the call stack.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Service1 as Service 1
    participant Service2 as Service 2
    participant Service3 as Service 3
    Client->>Service1: Request with Trace ID
    Service1->>Service2: Call with Trace ID
    Service2->>Service3: Call with Trace ID
    Service3-->>Service2: Response with Trace ID
    Service2-->>Service1: Response with Trace ID
    Service1-->>Client: Response with Trace ID
```

## Tracing Patterns Implementation <a name="tracing-patterns-implementation"></a>

Implementing tracing patterns in a microservices architecture involves a few key steps:

1. **Inject a Trace Identifier:** The trace identifier should be injected into the entry point of your system (e.g., a browser, an edge service, an ETL process). This identifier should span across all calls, even into the database if possible.

2. **Standardized Approach:** Avoid reinventing the wheel with a home-grown pattern and instead use an open standards-based approach. This allows you to use off-the-shelf tools to inspect your system.

3. **Embed the Trace ID in Log Messages:** With the trace identifier in place, you can easily embed this ID into all logs associated with a call. This provides an invaluable resource for diagnosing issues later on.

## Using APM for Visualizing Call Stacks <a name="using-apm-for-visualizing-call-stacks"></a>

Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tools can visualize call stacks, offering valuable insights into your system's behavior. Especially during troubleshooting, these visuals can significantly simplify understanding the path a service call takes.

```mermaid
graph LR
  A[Client] -- Request --> B[Edge Service]
  B -- Call --> C[Service 1]
  C -- Call --> D[Service 2]
  D -- Response --> C
  C -- Response --> B
  B -- Response --> A
  style B fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
  style C fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
  style D fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

## Leveraging Existing Patterns <a name="leveraging-existing-patterns"></a>

Tracing in microservices does not require recreating the wheel. Several robust tracing patterns already exist for systems as a whole, which also play nicely with microservices. It's highly recommended to use these pre-existing patterns and tools for building your system's tracing.
